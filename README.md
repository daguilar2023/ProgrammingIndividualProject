# Programming Individual Project – Mini Blackboard System

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **console-based mini Blackboard system** built in **Java**.  
It simulates a simplified version of an academic course management platform, allowing **administrators**, **teachers**, and **students** to interact within a structured object-oriented environment.

The project follows strong **OOP principles** including:
- Abstraction  
- Inheritance  
- Interfaces  
- Composition  
- Encapsulation  

It was developed as part of the **Programming II** course assignment to demonstrate software design, UML translation, and practical class hierarchy implementation.
